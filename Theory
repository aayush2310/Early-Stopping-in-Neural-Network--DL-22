Epochs
Using large value of epoch can cause overfitting.


tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(
    monitor="val_loss",
    min_delta=0,
    patience=0,
    verbose=0,
    mode="auto",
    baseline=None,
    restore_best_weights=False,
    start_from_epoch=0,
)


Aruements:-

1)monitor: Quantity to be monitored.

2)min_delta: Minimum change in the monitored quantity to qualify as an improvement, i.e. an absolute change of less than min_delta, will count as no improvement.

3)patience: Number of epochs with no improvement after which training will be stopped.

4)verbose: Verbosity mode, 0 or 1. Mode 0 is silent, and mode 1 displays messages when the callback takes an action.

5)mode: One of {"auto", "min", "max"}. In min mode, training will stop when the quantity monitored has stopped decreasing; in "max" mode it will stop when the 
        quantity monitored has stopped increasing; in "auto" mode, the direction is automatically inferred from the name of the monitored quantity.

6)baseline: Baseline value for the monitored quantity. Training will stop if the model doesn't show improvement over the baseline.

7)restore_best_weights: Whether to restore model weights from the epoch with the best value of the monitored quantity. If False, the model weights obtained at the last 
                        step of training are used. An epoch will be restored regardless of the performance relative to the baseline. If no epoch improves on baseline, 
                        training will run for patience epochs and restore weights from the best epoch in that set.

8)start_from_epoch: Number of epochs to wait before starting to monitor improvement. This allows for a warm-up period in which no improvement is expected and thus 
                    training will not be stopped.
